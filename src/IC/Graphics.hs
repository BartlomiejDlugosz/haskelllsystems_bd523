-- Sigh... Mac has a non-standard GLUT implementation and

-- close the window. Oh well. This uses the CPP language extension,
-- which invokes the C preprocessor on the file, allowing us
-- to write C-style macros to control stuff. In this case, if
-- we are operating in OSX, this macro is defined, so the code
-- inside the if will be removed
-- Thanks to Ethan Range (esr20) for figuring this out!
